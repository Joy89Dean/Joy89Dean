## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub repository! Iâ€™m a backend developer with solid experience in building fast, secure, and scalable APIs using Node.js, Express, and PostgreSQL. This repository showcases a collection of projects and code samples that reflect my approach to backend developmentâ€”focused on performance, reliability, and clean architecture.

Node.js and Express are the backbone of my server-side development. I use them to create RESTful APIs that are lightweight, efficient, and easy to integrate with front-end applications or third-party services. My work includes everything from basic CRUD operations to more complex systems involving authentication, authorization, and data validation. I prioritize writing modular, maintainable code with clear separation of concerns and proper error handling.

PostgreSQL is my preferred relational database due to its powerful query capabilities, data integrity, and robust performance. I design relational schemas that are normalized, optimized, and tailored to the needs of each application. From designing efficient queries to managing database migrations and indexing strategies, I make sure that the data layer is as strong and efficient as the application logic.

Security is a key aspect of my development workflow. I follow best practices when it comes to handling sensitive data, managing user authentication (including JWT and OAuth), and protecting against common vulnerabilities like SQL injection and XSS. Performance tuning, API versioning, and request validation are also part of my backend toolkit.

This repository features projects ranging from simple API setups to more complete back-end systems with integration tests, middleware, and deployment scripts. Iâ€™m always looking to improve my skills and collaborate with others who are passionate about backend development.

Feel free to browse, fork, or reach out if youâ€™re interested in working together or have suggestions to improve the code!
